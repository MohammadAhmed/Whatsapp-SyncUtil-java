(lol, here i typed some numbers and none of them got whatsapp so this dialog showed up)

======================

An app to sync phone numbers , and check if they had whatsapp


So there's 2 methods of typing numbers : 

1 - choose a txt file 

2- type the numbers your self but it will take some time so i prefer the first


===================================================================

to sync the phone numbers you need : 

1- type the username (phone number) , example : 96630088838

2-type your whatsapp password(you can get it in alot of ways , search in google)



===================================================================

Options

mode: sync mode (full or delta)
        context: sync context (registration, background or interactive)
        debug: enables debug output (you shouldn't check this until you know it very well !!)

===================================================================

Tested on :

Linux (yes and no problem)

windows (no)

Mac(no)


===================================================================

Note : 
to launch the app you must have WhatsapiNet-SyncUtil files
